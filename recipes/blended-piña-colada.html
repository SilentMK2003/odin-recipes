        <h2>What is the Piña Colada</h2>
            <p>The Piña Colada is a Puerto Rican rum drink made with pineapple juice (the name means “strained pineapple” in Spanish) and cream of coconut. By most accounts, the modern-day Piña Colada seems to have originated from a 1954 version that bartender named Ramón “Monchito” Marrero Perez shook up at The Caribe Hilton hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. While you may not be sipping this icy-cold tiki drink on the beaches of Puerto Rico, it’s sure to get you in a sunny mood no matter the season.</p>
        <h2>What Is the Best Rum for Making Piña Coladas?</h2>
            <p>Traditionally, the Piña Colada is made with white rum, but a dark rum, like an aged Spanish rum, also works wonderfully in Piña Coladas. Aged Spanish rums reflect the effects of time spent in the barrel, which are usually former charred bourbon barrels. These barrels bestow notes of vanilla, toasted marshmallow, and caramel that work well with the Piña Colada’s sweetness. Some Piña Colada recipes even call for layering a combination of light rum and dark rum.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>The Puerto Rican brand, Coco López, is the traditional cream of coconut used for Piña Coladas, but any brand will work. For an even fresher flavor, add a little lime juice to the slushy blend.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 oz rum</li>
                <li>3 oz fresh pineapple juice, chilled (or use frozen pineapple chunks for a smoothie-like texture)</li>
                <li>2 oz cream of coconut (or use a combination of sweetened coconut cream and coconut milk)</li>
                <li>1 ounce freshly squeezed lime juice (optional)</li>
                <li>2 cups ice</li>
                <li>Fresh pineapple, for garnish</li>
                <li>Maraschino cherries, for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a blender, combine rum, pineapple juice, cream of coconut, and lime juice (if using) with ice and blend until the drink reaches a milkshake-like consistency.</li>
