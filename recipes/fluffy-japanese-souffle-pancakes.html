        <h2>These Fluffy Japanese Soufflé Pancakes are like eating soft and cottony clouds!</h2>
            <p><strong>So pillowy soft and delicious! –</strong> These delicate pancakes are extra fluffy compared to regular flapjacks thanks to the air bubbles whipped into the egg whites. I love the fizzy sound of air bubbles escaping when I cut into them!</p>
            <p><strong>A comforting weekend treat –</strong> Pancakes are the happiest comfort food. This recipe is the perfect cooking project for a leisurely weekend brunch or a special occasion—think birthdays, anniversaries, Mother’s Day, or Valentine’s Day.</p>

                <li><strong>water -</strong> for steaming</li>
                <li>Toppings:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>confectioner's sugar</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>maple syrup</strong></li>

                        <li><strong>fresh berries -</strong> optional; I love using strawberries and blueberries</li>

            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the batter.</strong> Separate the egg whites and yolks into two bowls and put the bowl of whites in the freezer for 15 minutes. Whisk the yolks, milk, and vanilla extract with a mixer until thick and frothy. Sift the flour and baking powder into the liquid mixture and whisk by hand to combine; do not overmix.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the meringue and preheat the pan.</strong> Beat the half-frozen egg whites until frothy and opaque. Gradually add the sugar while beating at high speed until stiff peaks form. Look for meringue that holds a peak and has a tip that folds over. Start preheating a large, nonstick frying pan to 300ºF (150ºC) on the lowest heat and lightly grease it with oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Gently fold the meringue into the batter by hand.</strong> Use a hand whisk to fold in the whipped egg whites, one-third at a time. Gently incorporate without breaking the air bubbles. Mix until well combined and homogeneous.</li>
            <li><strong>Stack three scoops of batter for each pancake.</strong> Keep your preheated frying pan at 300ºF (150ºC) over low heat at all times. For the first pancake, place one small scoop of batter in the pan in a tall mound. Then, stack a second scoop on top. Repeat to make the other two pancakes. Then, mound a third scoop onto each, keeping the batter piled high.</li>
            <li><strong>Add water, cover, and set a timer for 6–7 minutes.</strong> A splash of water in the pan creates steam and covering with a lid locks in the moisture. After 2 minutes, add a final scoop of batter to each pancake. Cover and keep cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Flip over, add more water, and cover to finish cooking.</strong> When the timer goes off, use an offset spatula to very gently flip the pancakes with a “rolling over” motion. Add another splash of water and cover the pan. Set the timer for 4–5 minutes and cook until the other side is nicely browned.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve!</strong> Transfer to individual plates. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and drizzle with maple syrup. I love topping them with fresh whipped cream and fresh berries. Enjoy!</li>
