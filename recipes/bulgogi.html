        <h1>Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef)</h1>

        <h2>What is bulgogi</h2>
            <p>Literally speaking, bulgogi (불고기) means “fire meat”.  It is often made with tender parts of beef, pork or chicken. However, in general terms, unless specified, bulgogi is made with beef.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly it is one of the most well-known Korean traditional foods and it has been around for thousands of years. Naturally, the cooking method of bulgogi evolved over time and it varies by region too.</p>
            <p>However, to narrow our focus down, we will be talking about the most common way of making beef bulgogi in modern times.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Main</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>800 g / 1.76 pounds rib eye or top sirloin (or any tender prime beef cut), thinly sliced, 2mm to 3mm (1/8 inch) thickness</li>
                    <li>1 onion (130 g / 4.6 ounces), optional, peeled & thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>2 stalks green onion (55 g / 2 ounces), optional, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>1/2 carrot (55 g / 2 ounces), optional, peeled & thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp toasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sesame oil</a></a></li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp toasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sesame seeds</a></li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp cooking oil (I used rice bran oil)</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Bulgogi marinade</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 Tbsp soy sauce (I use regular <a href="https://www.kikkoman.co.uk/products/detail/kikkoman-naturally-brewed-soy-sauce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kikkoman soy sauce</a>)</li>
                    <li>3 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_wine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rice wine</a> (mirin)</li>
                    <li>1 asian pear or red apple (155 g / 5.5 ounces)</li>
                    <li>1/2 onion (80 g / 2.8 ounces)</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp minced garlic</li>
                    <li>1 tsp minced ginger</li>
                    <li>1/8 tsp ground black pepper</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Blend the marinade ingredients in a mixer or food processor until smooth. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Place the thinly sliced meat in a mixing bowl and pour the marinade over it. Mix them well together while gently massaging the meat with your hands. Add the sesame oil and mix it into the meat. Cover the bowl with cling wrap (or move the marinated meat into a glass container with a lid) and marinate the meat for at least 4 hours in the fridge. (If you have more time, you can also marinate it overnight to deepen the flavour even more).</li>
                    <li>Preheat a skillet / bbq grill on medium high heat until well heated. Add the cooking oil and spread it well. Add the meat (and vegetables) and cook it on medium high to high heat for 3 to 5 mins (until the meat and vegetables cook to your desired doneness). Toss in the sesame seeds and stir them quickly.</li>
                    <li>Serve the bulgogi with steamed rice and other <a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/category/side-dishes-banchan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean side dishes</a>. You can also use some lettuce leaves and <a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/korean-perilla-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perilla leaves</a> to wrap the bulgogi. Don’t forget to pair it with some Korean <a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/ssamjang-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ssamjang</a> (Korean bbq dipping sauce) and some kimchi (<a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/kimchi-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spicy kimchi</a> or <a href="https://mykoreankitchen.com/baek-kimchi-non-spicy-white-kimchi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white kimchi</a>) too!</li>
                </ol>
        <h2>How to store</h2>
            <p>Store cooked bulgogi in the fridge for a few days. For uncooked, marinated bulgogi, keep it fresh in the fridge for 3 to 4 days, or it can be frozen for a few weeks, ensuring it’s placed in an airtight container.</p>
